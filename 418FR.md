**1.** *Provide a URL for your final project. If you created a Shiny App
as your data product, you should include a link to the GitHub repository
that contains your code as well as a link to your Shiny App hosted on
shinyapp.io (see Chapter 2 of the shinyapps.io User Guide - this is
free, but you need to sign up for an account). If you created some other
type of data product, you should include a link to the GitHub repository
that contains your code as well as a direct link to your data product.*

**3.** *Write me a letter that reflects on your work in this class.Talk
about the work you’ve done for the course so far. Remember that I am
interested in the progress have you made towards each course-level
learning objectives. Look through your work to determine what you could
use to demonstrate your progress. (Provide links to or embed examples of
your work.) How does your work demonstrate your progress towards these
objectives? Consider the work you did on the final project, your work
earlier in the term, the feedback you offered your peers on their work,
and how you met your own goals. Feel free to include more links to
examples of your work as necessary (please point directly to the
specific work - not some general document link - so that I can easily
review it). Tell me what you are particularly proud of. This is the
place to be as honest as possible about your work, both reflecting
critically and talking about what you proved capable of in the midst of
an incredibly challenging semester. Remember that this is a reflection
about your work, not your classmates.*

Most of the objectives are fulfilled by the final project; particularly
objectives 1, 2, 4, and 5.

Areas I plan to cover outside of project in this reflection:

-   summarize (if we don’t add it to project but think we might)
-   tidy data & transformations (pivots) (or just the transform func
    stuff)
-   joins
-   simulations
-   functions

**Import, manage, and clean data**

-   I can import data from a variety of sources.
-   I can isolate information from a larger data source.
-   I can combine information from multiple data sources.
-   I can restructure information to be in a “tidy” format.
-   I can transform information to be in a format better suited for
    specific tasks.

I’ve learned so much in this class! I feel comfortable reading in data
and manipulating it to some degree (it’s always the stupid mistakes that
get me, *cough cough*, back ticks).

See the “CLEAN DATA” section of the project rmd file. In these chunks I
removed unwanted rows/cols, renamed variables, and converted some
variable types; which helped improve the readability/manageability of
the data set. GPA and age make more sense when used as a numeric value
as well.

filter(!is.na()) is my bff in many instances because of how our survey
worked. For example; when looking at graduate students there were many
N/A’s for those observations that were either undergraduate or combined
degree students (which would be unnecessary to include). By filtering
out those N/A’s it greatly reduced the \# of obs I was working with. I
could then save that tibble and make it it’s own data set to use later
if I wanted.

**Outside of the “CLEAN DATA” area of project:**

A topic I think I need more practice on is the concept of tidy data and
table pivots. Maybe it’s because I haven’t encountered data that appears
“untidy” to me? The concept of transforming the dataset so that “every
column is a variable, every row is an observation, and every cell is a
single value” I understand. The examples from Activity 6 were fine but
I’m not sure what else we do with pivots. (probs adding examples might
look messy data?)

-   examples of using group\_by, summarize, and sorting: degrees types
    by average gpa. Who’s doing the worst??

``` r
rest_habits %>% 
        filter(!is.na(gpa)) %>% 
        group_by(degree) %>% 
        summarise(count = n(),
                  avgGPA = mean(gpa)) %>% 
        arrange(avgGPA)
```

    ## # A tibble: 3 x 3
    ##   degree          count avgGPA
    ##   <chr>           <int>  <dbl>
    ## 1 Undergraduate      73   3.46
    ## 2 Graduate           16   3.62
    ## 3 Combined Degree     7   3.82

-   which countries have the highest rated wines (and the cheapest?)

``` r
wine <- wine %>% 
  select(country, designation:winery) # don't need 1st col or description

wine %>% 
        filter(!is.na(price)) %>%
        filter(!is.na(country)) %>% # can you filter two vars at the same time? google
        group_by(country) %>% 
        summarise(count = n(),
                  avgPoints = round(mean(points)),
                  avgPrice = round(mean(price), 2)) %>%
        arrange(desc(avgPoints), avgPrice)
```

    ## # A tibble: 42 x 4
    ##    country    count avgPoints avgPrice
    ##    <chr>      <int>     <dbl>    <dbl>
    ##  1 England       69        92     51.7
    ##  2 India          9        90     13.3
    ##  3 Austria     2799        90     30.8
    ##  4 Germany     2120        90     42.3
    ##  5 China          1        89     18  
    ##  6 Morocco       28        89     19.5
    ##  7 Luxembourg     6        89     23.3
    ##  8 Australia   2294        89     35.4
    ##  9 Canada       254        89     35.7
    ## 10 US         54265        89     36.6
    ## # … with 32 more rows

These are examples of how I can use functions we’ve learned to isolate
information from a larger data set to answer specific questions I may
have.

**Create graphical displays and numerical summaries of data for
exploratory analysis and presentations**

-   I can create tables of numerical summaries that draw attention to
    important comparisons.
-   I can create graphical displays of data that highlight key features.
-   I can combine multiple graphical displays or numerical summaries
    into an effective data product.

Visualizations in R are great. With tidyverse & ggplot you can make
things that don’t look they were made back in the early 2000’s (I’m
looking at you, base R). More recently since the midterm reflection I’ve
discovered the mosaic plots. These seem super fun for categorical
variables and it wasn’t something I was aware of previously.

-   I want to make the tibble I made in the section above easier to
    read. Using kable to make a nicer table. I could have just piped the
    kable at the end of creating the table. but decided to assign my
    previous code to a name. It makes more sense to me to do these two
    things separately.

``` r
avg_gpa_byDegree <- rest_habits %>% 
        filter(!is.na(gpa)) %>% 
        group_by(degree) %>% 
        summarise(count = n(),
                  avgGPA = mean(gpa)) %>% 
        arrange(avgGPA)
#making a table
avg_gpa_byDegree %>% 
  kable(col.names=c('Degree Type', 'Count', 'Average GPA'), caption="Average GPA by Degree") %>% 
  kable_styling()
```

(run a simulation)

(write a function)

**Use source documentation and other resources to troubleshoot and
extend R programs**

-   I can identify and correct common errors and in R programs.
-   I can explore new functions or packages and implement them into
    analyses.
-   I can identify and correct common collaboration errors when working
    with Git/GitHub.

**Write clear, efficient, and well-documented R programs**

-   I can use a project-based workflow to organize and run reproducible
    analyses.
-   I can write professional reports using R Markdown.
-   I can call a separate R script containing self-created functions to
    then be used within an analysis.
-   I can write comments that explain the “why” (Why did you choose this
    approach instead of an alternative? What else did you try that
    didn’t work?) of my code.

(talk about experience with GitHub, overcoming errors, project/rmd file
layout)

**4.** *Based on the progress you have made (i.e., see your response in
(3)), what final grade would you give yourself for this course? Try to
stick to the major grade levels (“A”, “B”, “C”, or “D or below”). Please
reach out to me if you have concerns or were unable to finish your final
project.*

A

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**5.** *Do you have any other thoughts or reflections about the course
that you’d like to share?*

I think this class rocked! I certainly know what I’m going to be doing
over break… I’m not a particularly quick learner and I felt overwhelmed
most of the time but I still enjoyed the course. I wish I would have
taken this during an easier semester so I could commit more time. It’s
crazy how fast class time goes.

There should be a part 2 where we can build on the basics.
